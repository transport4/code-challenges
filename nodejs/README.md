# Objective

1. Create a simple "Taco Recipe" REST API. 

2. Use the latest NodeJS Framework and Typescript

3. Our preference is an AWS serverless API project built using AWS SAM or [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework.  If you are unable to use one of these, a classic Express API will suffice.  You should be able to create a free AWS account, and run the serverless features required for an API on [their free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23serverless) for this exercise.

4.  When you're finished, please push your code to GitHub and send a link to matt.marooney@transport4.com
 
# API Requirements

1. Consumers of the API should be able access full REST endpoints for the following actions:
    - Creating Taco recipes 
    - Updating Taco recipes
    - Deleting Taco recipes
    - Retrieving a list of Taco recipes
    - Retrieve list of Taco sauces from Spoonacular.com Ingredient API
    - Post Taco Recipe to Spoonacular.com API and return Recipe Card image

2. Taco recipes consist of the following data:
    - Recipe Name
    - Recipe Description
    - Recipe Instructions
    - Ingredients:
        - Taco Shell
        - Taco Protein(s)
        - Taco Topping(s)
        - Taco Sauce(s)

3. The API should use some sort of mock DB and/or caching to persist the Taco recipe data

4. The API should contain at least one "positive" unit test and one "negative" unit test

5. Use best-practice REST specifications, async patterns, clean coding practices, and your creativity and ingenuity!
